      <p>
        Programmer with strong front-end skills, a background in customer
        service and an eye for aesthetics in design. I have a strong sense of
        self-management as well as a deep-seated desire for personal
        development. Coding was a hobby (in my early youth) that I have recently
        rediscovered, and reinvigorated, my passion for. A combination of
        technical expertise and emotional intelligence allows me to be a unique
        team member that will bring efficiency and value to your team; coupled
        with experience in collaborative, deadline-driven environments, make me
        a strong addition to any data analysis team. I seek a role in Web
        Development at a company where I can learn and continue my journey to
        master the ever-changing craft of code.
